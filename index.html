        <h1>CTF Guide</h1>

        <h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
        <p>A CTF, also known as Capture the Flag, is a cybersecurity competition where players participate in a variety of challenges to try to find a hidden “flag,” which usually is a piece of text. This guide provides a quick rundown of what you need to do in a CTF.</p>

        <h2>Basic Walkthrough</h2>
        <p>Begin by reading the instructions carefully. Clues are often hidden in the title or instructions. Next, examine the files provided in the challenge, which may include images, text files, or links.</p>
        <p>If it’s a webpage challenge, inspect the source code. If it’s a downloadable file, check its metadata for any hidden information.</p>

        <h2>Types of CTFs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Challenges involving encryption and decryption. Common ciphers include Base64, ROT13, and XOR.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Exploitation:</strong> Finding vulnerabilities in compiled programs, such as buffer overflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Analyzing software or executables to understand their functionality and extract the flag.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Security:</strong> Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection or XSS.</li>
            <li><strong>Forensics:</strong> Investigating files, images, or network traffic to extract hidden information.</li>
            <li><strong>Steganography:</strong> Hiding messages in images, audio files, or other media formats.</li>
            <li><strong>Pwn:</strong> Exploiting system vulnerabilities and executing malicious code.</li>
            <li><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Various other challenges, including OSINT and trivia-based puzzles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li>Read the instructions again.</li>
            <li>Look into the provided hints.</li>
            <li>Search for deeper clues or hidden hints.</li>
            <li>Start inspecting or extracting data from anything that looks suspicious.</li>
            <li>Look for similar CTFs online, as some challenges are common.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <code>Ctrl + U</code> to inspect a webpage’s source code.</li>
            <li>Think like the creator—where would they hide the flag?</li>
            <li>Change your approach if you're stuck at a dead end.</li>
            <li>Work systematically—keep track of what you've tried.</li>
            <li>Google is your best friend when dealing with ciphers and decoding methods.</li>
        </ul>
